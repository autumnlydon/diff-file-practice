# diff-file-practice

## This is an experiment so I can learn how to use `.diff` files. I want to learn how to upload and manipulate `.diff` files in **cook'd**.

### Step 1: Initialization

- Create a project in VS Code with short, legible code.
- Commit changes, and push to Github
- Make more changes
- Stage changes
- Use `.diff` command to create a diff file that documents changes made between initial commit and new changes.

### Step 2: Cook'd

- Meow
